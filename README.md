# This repository is an analysis of how to handle time sequences in different modeling tasks

#### Original Paper
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05321">Time2Vec: Learning a Vector Representation of Time</a>

#### Original Code
Code was initially taken from <a href="https://github.com/ojus1/Time2Vec-PyTorch">this repository.</a> I have been working and modifying the code based on my understanding and need. So, the code will not be exactly the same as original repo.

#### Documentation of my understanding
<a href="https://github.com/MdArafatHKhan/Time-2-Vector-Analysis/tree/main/Documentation">Complete documentation of the code.</a> I tried to write in a concrete mathematical way to do the analysis.
